/*
   Disk I/O is in units of blocks. You can read a complete block or
   write a complete block. Each block is a sequence of bytes of size
   64 bytes. File system or disk manager objects store some specific
   data structures in these blocks. So, you need a mechanism for converting
   these data structures to sequence of bytes of size 64 bytes, and vice
   versa. Some examples of how to do this are given below.
